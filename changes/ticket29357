  o Minor features (dormant mode):
    - Add a DormantCanceledByStartup option to tell Tor that it should
      treat a startup event as cancelling any previous dormant state.
      Integrators should use this option with caution: it should
      only be used if Tor is being started because of something that the
      user did, and not if Tor is being automatically started in the
      background. Closes ticket 29357.

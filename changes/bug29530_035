  o Minor bugfixes (testing):
    - Downgrade some LOG_ERR messages in the address/* tests to warnings.
      The LOG_ERR messages were occurring when we had no configured network.
      We were failing the unit tests, because we backported 28668 to 0.3.5.8,
      but did not backport 29530. Fixes bug 29530; bugfix on 0.3.5.8.

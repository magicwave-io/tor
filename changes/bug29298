  o Minor bugfixes (testing, circuit padding):
    - Disabled unstable circuit padding unittest that was causing intermittent
      test failures because of ill-defined small histogram. Such histograms
      will be allowed again after 29298 is implemented. Fixes second case of
      bug 29122; bugfix on 0.4.0.1-alpha.

  o Minor features (testing):
    - When running tests that attempt to look up hostname, replace the libc
      name lookup functions with ones that do not actually touch the network.
      This way, the tests complete more quickly in the presence of a slow or
      missing DNS resolver. Closes ticket 31841.

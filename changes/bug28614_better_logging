  o Minor bugfixes (logging):
    - On Windows, when errors cause us to reload a consensus from disk, tell
      the user that we are retrying at log level "notice". Previously we only
      logged this information at "info", which was confusing because the
      errors themselves were logged at "warning". Improves previous fix for
      28614.  Fixes bug 30004; bugfix on 0.4.0.2-alpha.

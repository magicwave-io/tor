  o Major bugfixes (hidden service v3):
    - Make onion service always use the exact amount of configured intro points
      (or less due to node exlusion). Before, a service could sometimes pick
      more intro points than configured with the
      HiddenServiceNumIntroductionPoints option. Fixes bug 31548; bugfix on
      0.3.2.1-alpha.

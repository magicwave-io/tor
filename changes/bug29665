  o Minor bugfixes (single onion services):
    - Allow connections to single onion services to remain idle without
      being disconnected. Relays acting as rendezvous points for
      single onion services were mistakenly closing idle established
      rendezvous circuits after 60 seconds, thinking that they are unused
      directory-fetching circuits that had served their purpose. Fixes
      bug 29665; bugfix on 0.2.1.26.

  o Minor bugfixes (onion services):
    - When we clean up intro circuits for a v3 onion service, don't remove
      circuits that have an established or pending circuit even if ran out of
      retries. This way, we don't cleanup the circuit of the last retry. Fixes
      bug 31652; bugfix on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
